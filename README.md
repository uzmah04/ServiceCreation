# ServiceCreation

The project is about the creation of a system service which would detect a USB.
The program will mount the USB in a folder, will create a texte file, write the date in the text file and then unmount the USB.
At the end, there must be a texte file in the USB in which the date has been written.

The script usb.sh is provided, only the service will have to be created.

Steps to create the service:

    - First clone the project
      >   $ git clone
